            Nobody deserves the indignity of having to use ashes, leaves, 
            newspapers, used socks, old mattress cuttings or rags to catch
            her menstrual flow. These crude materials are not only ineffective
            but also unhygienic and uncomfortable in catching menstrual flow.
            In Liberia, going girls of menstrual age are either forced to endure
            this humiliation or be absent from schools and other daily life activities.
            Many confess to facing stigma that comes from unhygienic menstrual hygiene
            management, the odor of improperly managed menstrual blood or shocking stories
            of how they did not know what to do during their first menstrual period. 
            This year, to mark the annual celebration of Menstrual Hygiene Day, the
            Office of the First Lady of the Republic of Liberia in collaboration with
            the Clar Hope Foundation is stressing the plight of Liberian girls.
            In partnership with the Government of Liberia through the Ministry of Gender,
            the Foundation is highlighting this topic to educate and empower the most
            vulnerable women and girls and particularly those living with disabilities.
            The Clar Hope Foundation believes that young girls should not beleft alone
            to make these tough choices. They should be supported, empowered, and allowed
            to have their menstrual periods in a safe, confident, and dignified manner.
            In a bid to restore dignity to these girls, retain them in school and enable
            them to face their periods with confidence, 
            the Foundation is launching the She&quot;s You Project.

           The aim of this project is to break the silence on menstrual matters, debunk the
           myths and misconceptions on this subject area, sensitize boys and girls on menstruation
           and to donate sanitary towels to needy girls of menstrual age. Background Each year, the

           around the vital role that good menstrual hygiene management (MHM) plays in empowering women and
           adolescent girls worldwide to become all that they can be. The vision behind MH Day is a world in
           which every woman and girl is able to manage her menstruation in a hygienic way- in safety, privacy,
           and with dignity- wherever they are. This year, the Office of the First Lady of the Republic of Liberia,
           in collaboration with the Clar Hope Foundation, and the Government of Liberia through the Ministry of Gender,
           is putting a highlight on this topic to educate and empower the most vulnerable women and girls and particularly
           those living with disabilities.The First Lady, Mrs. Clar Marie Weah, is a strong proponent of this endeavor and
           wants all women and girls living with or without disabilities to be inclusive in the fight for national
           menstrual hygiene and better sanitation. It is against this backdrop that this concept is being proffer to
           provide the needed assistance for our women and girls with the below goal and general objectives:
